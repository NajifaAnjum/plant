<div class="container">
<h3 style="color:#16A085; padding-top: 10px;"> plants based on your light<br></h3><br>
<p style="color:black; text-align:left; font-family: tahoma;">Our #1 rule is to determine the amount of natural lightyour space receives, and to choose your plant accordingly.<br> If you are not sure just by looking, start by figuring out which direction your windows face.<br>

Generally speaking, south-facing windows give bright light, east & west-facing windows give moderate light, and north-facing windows give low light.<br> If there is something outside your window , for example, a large tree or building that could obstruct sunlight, make sure to take that into consideration, too.<br>
 Most houseplants prefer bright, indirect sunlight, but many can tolerate lower light levels (like low light tolerant snake plants).<br>

If the sun is intense through your windows, you may want to add a sheer curtain to diffuse the light.<br> Cacti and some succulents like aloe can handle brighter, direct sunlight.<br> You do not want to overexpose or underexpose any plant so keep an eye on them if they're in very bright or very low light.</p><br>
<h3 style="color:#16A085;">Pick plants that work with your schedule</h3><br>
<p style="color:black; text-align:left; font-family: tahoma;">a busy life and general forgetfulness can lead to unintentional plant neglect.<br>
 It is okay. Some plants can handle that kind of lifestyle.<br>
 A jetsetter like yourself will enjoy the resilience of low-maintenance and drought-tolerant succulents,<br> all pretty low key, as long as they have enough light (bright and low light respectively).<br> 
 
 These should keep looking their best when you return from your next trip.<br>
If you have got more time, you can try a few attention-loving air plants, orchids, or ferns. <br>Like a mist for the face, an extra spritz of filtered water daily between waterings keeps humidity levels nice and balanced for these delicate plants
</p><br>
<h3 style="color:#16A085";​ >Be mindful when watering</h3><br>
<p style="color:black; text-align:left; font-family: tahoma;">It is better to under water your plants than to overwater. Too much water can lead to root rot. <br>
Ditch your watering schedule and water your plant only when it needs it. Check the potting mix or soil first to make sure it is dry at least 2 inches deep below the surface. <br>
If your soil looks dark in color, feels moist, and sticks to your finger, your plant has enough water to do it is thing for now.<br>
How often you water will also change throughout the year. Plants need less water in the winter months,<br> when they are growing slower, the days are shorter and sunlight is less intense. <br>
If the heat is on and their soil is drying out quicker, they may need a bit more water.<br>
 Wilting leaves or soil that looks pulled away from the sides of the planter are signs of a thirsty plant.<br>
Always use warm water because it absorbs best. Pour water directly on the soil around the base of the plant, because plants absorb water from their roots.<br>
 The only exception here is Epiphytes, like air plants, who absorb water through their leaves.<br>

You can also place a saucer under your planter, if it has a drainage hole.<br>
 After you water, let your plant soak up in access water that fills the saucer for a few hours before emptying it.</p><br>
 
<h3 style="color:#16A085";​ >Know when to skip the fertilizer</h3><br>
<p style="color:black; text-align:left; font-family: tahoma;">Be mindful when using fertilizer on your houseplants. Too much fertilizer can do more harm than good.<br>
 Houseplants tend to not need fertilizer as often as outdoor plants do. If you do choose to fertilize your plant,<br>
 it is best to do so during the growing season (early spring to early fall) and follow the general rule of thumb:less is more. <br>
 Most store bought fertilizers should be diluted with water before use.<br>

If you have had your plant for at least year, you can fertilize it for the first time.<br>
 We suggest using an all-purpose fertilizer. Always follow the instructions.<br>
 If you have just changed the soil, skip the fertilizer! Fresh soil has enough new nutrients.</p><br>
 
 
<h3 style="color:#16A085";​ > Keep drainage in mind</h3><br>
<p style="color:black; text-align:left; font-family: tahoma;">
If you tend to have a heavy hand when watering your plants, keep drainage in mind.<br>
 You can opt for a planter with a drainage hole and saucer, keep your plant in a grow pot nestled inside a planter,<br>
 or add lava rocks to the bottom of a planter without a hole (to create crevices for excess water to flow to).<br>
 Do what works best for you! Do not be afraid to try different methods for different plants.
